Various uncertain human factors have caused the entire platform to cease to exist, leaving many \n'S followers are suffering hard to choose. \nIf you want to solve these factors and problems, you must have a distributed application that cannot be closed, tampered with, and open and transparent. \nETHEREUM PROFESSIONAL SMART CONTRACT DISTRIBUTED DIGITAL GAME came into being in such a large environment. It is a decentralized network based on the innovative development of smart contract developers around the world. \nAn application that executes automatically.",
    "content_4": "ETH PRO (abbreviation of ETHEREUM PROFESSIONAL SMART CONTRACT DISTRIBUTED DIGITAL GAME) is the world's first decentralized application of lotto games based on the Ethereum network with multiple mechanisms. \nThe original intention of ETH PRO design is to create a fair, just, transparent, deceptive, tamper-proof, and continuously running decentralized new smart contract platform. Those participating in the ETH PRO game only support the use of ETH, the world â€™s second largest cryptocurrency, in-game rewards \nThe settlement withdrawal is also ETH. The ETH PRO deployed on the Ethereum network innovatively combines the six-layer protocol and the two-layer fund mechanism (distributed protocol, redemption protocol, EPRO protocol, Bancor protocol, TOP protocol, treasure box protocol, insurance) \nFunds, ecological development funds), these first-in-one fusion designs truly achieve 100% of all participating ETH can be distributed to each community member, allowing each member to continuously precipitate and accumulate through time, quickly and justly amplify you \nThe number of ETH.",

The members come from the early evangelists of the global Ethereum community and the early development members of Ethereum and the development enthusiasts of global smart contracts. \nETH PRO is a decentralized smart contract platform with only global community operations and development, and no central controller. Every member of the ETH PRO community is an evangelist, a participant, an operator and a developer. \nThe smart contract code related to ETH PRO will be completely open source, which means that once it starts running, the relevant code triggered by the smart contract will be automatically executed, because as long as the ETH public chain exists, it will continue to run uninterrupted, so we believe ETH \nPRO will be the best ETH lotto game smart contract platform for you.",
